# Customer-Segmentation-ML-Project


This is a Marketing Analytics project.The main model here is to segregate customers into different groups so that we can identify the different
groups of customers coming into the mall.

If we know the different groups of customers coming into a mall and their spending behaviors, we can
serve different marketing strategies for different groups of customers.

Here I used clustering analysis method. and implemented customer segmentation using k-means clustering in python.
